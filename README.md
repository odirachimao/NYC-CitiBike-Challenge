# NYC-CitiBike-Challenge

## PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT:

This project uses data from the Citi Bike sharing program in NYC to determine the possibility of this being a replicable program in Des Moines, Iowa. It explores different trends including gender, user types, start and end time, that would help convince investors that a bike-sharing business is a solid proposal for Des Moines. To finish this project, I cleaned up the data using python’s pandas’ 
package and then produced visuals using Tableau. 

## RESULTS:

## •	Checkout Times for User: 

Most of the bikers that take bike-share tend to ride for less than an hour with the peak being at least 5 minutes – 10 minutes. This shows that most of our bikers are using the bikes to take shorter trips and they are local commuters.

## •	Checkout Times by Gender: 

Males are significantly higher users than the rest of the bikers. They make up most of the riders and tend to use the service more on weekdays.

## •	Trips by Weekday for Each Hour:

Peak periods for ridership tend to be during the morning and evening rush hour commuting periods typically between 6-10am and 5-8pm during the weekdays.  However, ridership is consistent throughout the course of the day on Saturday and Sundays.

## •	Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour): 

Males are the highest users during the peak hours. For example, we have more male riders than female riders from 5pm to 8pm.

## •	User Trips by Gender by Weekday:

Male users are the highest subscribers followed by female users. Male subscribers tend to use the service during the weekdays, while non-subscribers use the service during the weekends.

## •	Rides per hour:

Non-peak hours are between 1am – 5am. Around these times the number of rides drop to less than 20k.

## •	Location per Rides:

The most densely populated areas of Manhattan, especially the midtown area accounted for most rides.

## SUMMARY: 

These are the key findings from the above findings for establishing a successful Citi bike programme in Des Moines: 

1.	Bikes should be placed in densely populated areas around the city because those are where majority of the customers will be located. 

2.	Men should be the main target in advertisements because they are the primary user group. 


Additional Visualizations: 

1.	I would recommend visually analyzing the different age groups of each gender to get a clearer idea of what their target audience will be. 

2.	I would recommend visualizing where customers are traveling to so we can get more insight to who the “unknown users” are, whether they are NY customers or visitors coming for the day.
