# NYC-CitiBike-Challenge
## PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT:

This project uses data from the Citi Bike sharing program in NYC to determine the possibility of this being a replicable program in Des Moines, Iowa. It explores different trends including gender, user types, start and end time, that would help convince investors that a bike-sharing business is a solid proposal for Des Moines. To finish this project, I cleaned up the data using python’s pandas’ 
package and then produced visuals using Tableau.
